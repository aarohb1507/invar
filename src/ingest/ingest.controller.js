/**
 * Ingest Controller
 * 
 * NOTE: This file is intentionally minimal. 
 * The ingestion logic is handled directly in ingest.service.js 
 * for simplicity in this demo application.
 * 
 * In a production application, this would contain:
 * - Request validation
 * - Rate limiting logic
 * - Authentication/authorization
 * - Request/response transformation
 * - Error handling middleware
 * 
 * For now, all logic is in the service layer to keep the demo simple.
